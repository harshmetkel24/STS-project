                    This situation is unprecedented. Though there was the
                    bubonic plague in the medieval times, it was not on this
                    scale. The SARS-Cov-19 virus has infected over 21.9 crore
                    people worldwide, the official numbers are expected to be
                    quite larger. Nearly 45.5 lakh people had to face untimely
                    death, and this is just the officially recorded number. The
                    virus attracted political attention from around the world.
                    There was the question of the origin of the virus. The role
                    of the WHO, the role of the so-called superpowers and the
                    treatment facilities provided to the people in the affected
                    countries were put into the sack of questions.

                    We cannot be sure of the rhythm of appearance as its causes
                    are not periodic in nature like the migration of birds and
                    animals due to change in seasons. It happens due to a sudden
                    change in the environment which is quite unpredictable.
                    Although, if we consider all the migrations in history due
                    to various reasons, there may appear a rhythm in their
                    occurrences.
