                    Socio-economic knowledge:<br />
                    The economic and social status of the workers is one of the
                    most important factors to consider. The financial condition
                    of the workers determines the availability of transport and
                    other facilities. Workers may be discriminated based on
                    caste, creed, race, religion, or sex while providing them
                    aid.<br /><br />
                    Political knowledge:<br />
                    The government and the political heads of the state play a
                    crucial role. There might be sanctions or on the other hand
                    some provisions which help the workers to migrate from the
                    area to their homelands. Also, the transport facilities
                    including rail and road, are under the control of the state.
                    Also, the governments may impose lockdowns and ban the
                    movement of large numbers of people across the states to
                    stop the spread of the virus.<br /><br />
                    Geographical knowledge:<br />
                    The geography and location of the region are also taken into
                    consideration by workers when deciding to migrate. Length of
                    the journey is also a point to consider.

                    It is the news agencies and the media which are the main
                    source of information regarding the matter. The news
                    agencies ideally are not swayed by the government but we do
                    not disregard the possibility of that. So, it is the media
                    and the government who demarcate knowledge about the
                    subject. <br />Also, the media may create hype about the
                    incidents involved in the process and increase their TRP
                    rating. We also do not deny the possibility of anti-social
                    elements who try to spread unrest by spreading fake news and
                    bribing the news agencies to adulterate the facts with
                    fiction.

                    The heads of the states and the bureaucratic experts are the
                    main actors in this network. Also, there might be some other
                    individuals and groups which may play a role in this
                    scenario. Film stars like Sonu Sood and NGOs across the
                    country have more or less helped the workers to reach their
                    homes amidst the pandemic.

                    There were many controversies around the worker migration.
                    There were questions on the transparency of the PM cares
                    fund. Also, there were doubts whether Sonu Soodâ€™s team was
                    hoarding the medicines for treatment of Covid. The use of
                    harmful chemicals to sanitise the poor workers was also
                    questioned. Some state governments banned the entry and exit
                    of workers under the pretext of stopping the Covid spread.

                    The workers are usually the daily wage earners. Though most
                    of them are labourers and masons working at construction
                    sites and factories, some are also street vendors selling
                    fruit, veggies and other edible items.

                    The medicos are concerned about the mass transmission of
                    virus due to the infringement of Covid protocols while
                    workers migrate in large groups.<br />
                    There may also be legal issues of identity and criminal
                    cases. This type of situation is usually a soft target for
                    criminal activities.<br />
                    The religious fraternity though may not be directly
                    involved, may be responsible for communal tensions during
                    the migration process.<br />
                    These events leave a deep and long-lasting effect on the
                    mentality and psychology of the people. The need to abandon
                    everything and move to a different place without any jobs or
                    future security is an extremely difficult decision to
                    take.<br />
                    There is a need for proper engineering solutions so that the
                    people can migrate to their destination conveniently and
                    safely. There is a lot of pressure on the civil and public
                    infrastructure which has to be looked after by the
                    engineers.<br />
                    It not being a cross country issue the military is not
                    involved. However, in cases where the situation goes out of
                    control the CRPF and Army are requested to ensure peace and
                    safety of the people.<br />
                    There is imminent danger to the economics of the region from
                    where the workers migrate and also to the place to where the
                    workers migrate. Migration results in the dearth of labour
                    personnel, while on the other hand there may be large
                    numbers of unemployed people.<br />
