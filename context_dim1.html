                    Virtually everywhere in the world, across and among the

                    change of state control, migration for trade and migration

                    This is quite related to the cause of the appearance of the
                    event. It begins as a change in the surroundings of the
                    people. Gradually the condition worsens and people are
                    forced to leave behind everything and go out to search for a
                    living. It appears next to the vicious cycle of poverty and
                    unemployment in the deprived regions of the world.

                    People migrate when they see that the environment can no
                    longer sustain their daily basic requirements. It appears
                    due to a large-scale shift in dynamics of the region â€“ be it
                    political, social, economic or physiological. Shutdown of
                    factories, fall of economy, toppling of government, rise of
                    foreign power, inflation, pandemics and epidemics are the
                    major reasons for the appearance of large-scale migration of
                    people, workers in particular.

                    This matters as it involves various dimensions of the
                    society be it labour, material, technological, political,
                    economic, bodily, historic, educational or symbolic.
                    Migration changes the dynamics of places from where and the
                    places to which people migrate. It can cause a chain
                    reaction of developments in different areas which could
                    affect the lives of a large number of people.
