                    Migration of workers raises various political issues. It

                    Economy is halted due to lock-downs. Unemployment and
                    poverty make the situation worse.

                    People migrate when they see that the environment can no
                    longer sustain their daily basic requirements. It appears
                    due to a large-scale shift in dynamics of the region â€“ be it
                    political, social, economic or physiological. Shutdown of
                    factories, fall of economy, toppling of government, rise of
                    foreign power, inflation, pandemics and epidemics are the
                    major reasons for the appearance of large-scale migration of
                    people, workers in particular.

                    This matters as it involves various dimensions of the

                    economic, bodily, historic, educational or symbolic.
                    Migration changes the dynamics of places from where and the
                    places to which people migrate. It can cause a chain
                    reaction of developments in different areas which could
                    affect the lives of a large number of people.
