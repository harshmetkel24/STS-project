                    There are people so there are bodies and hence there is an
                    organic dimension to the issue.<br />
                    There are elements of sight, touch, hearing, smell and
                    taste. There is the sight of the plight of the poor workers
                    forced to abandon and leave their place. There are sounds of
                    fear and agony. There is the smell of misery and
                    deprivation. There is this virus ready to infect you. There
                    is the taste of the bitter consequences of getting infected.

                    There is attention from the world. There is attention from
                    the public. In the case of humans, as the picture suggests,
                    In the families of migrant workers, they highly depend on
                    their daily wages and as a result all the future plans,
                    dreams, emotional and mental stability of the family members
                    depend on the payscale and the employment of the worker, and
                    thus they were highly affected on both emotional and
                    physical terms because of this pandemic scapegoat. <br />
                    Most of the construction or similar organisations have
                    layers of working, the upper layer that conducts the board
                    meetings and carries out the decisions , the mid layer where
                    all the office work relies and the lower layer where all the
                    physical work is being done by the workers. We all know that
                    the most affected category in these layers are the workers.
                    And they don't have backup finance and also they all rely on
                    the daily pay.

                    In case we own or have power of decision in a similar
                    organisation then as in the covid era the income had been
                    lower than the deepest valley, all we could do is to cut off
                    some of the workers so that we could sustain our company and
                    the lower category was the easiest to let lose because the
                    middle office work layer would require resources of
                    interview, internships etc for re establishment while this
                    lowest layer does not require such a high amount of
                    resources to re establish even post covid.<br />
                    In case we are normal citizens. Then because of this covid
                    era we shifted our sentiments and our priorities. We shifted
                    to things of basic requirement and thus a major chunk of the
                    companies had to lose their revenue for those 1 or two
                    years. Especially real estate and the automobile were the
                    two such sectors that were affected a lot.
                    <br />
                    Now as normal citizens , whose job is either paused or
                    income is reduced then we try to minimize our costs of
                    living and this affects the companies that provide
                    employment to these workers and thus we enhance this problem
                    , as a mutual side effect of our attempts. Thus the methods
                    that we adopted were necessary and important for us but they
                    proved to be drastic and lethal for others.

                    In the covid era we truly experienced the notion of “The

                    necessary and important to be done by people or

                    Travel and transportation is one of the bodies that made
                    huge use of this situation for its profit. The migrant
                    workers had to move to their hometown and they, being not
                    able to afford trains or flights , relied on the local road
                    transport. The prices of the tickets ranged somewhere
                    between 5 to 10 times their normal price. As the workers
                    would have no other option but to buy the tickets, the
                    travels and transportation made huge profits.<br />
                    Another industry that made huge use of this situation is the
                    life dependencies and the medical industry. Life
                    dependencies like grains, sugar, vegetables etc were sold at
                    2 to 3 times their original prices and the things of basic
                    requirement in covid, masks, sanitisers , wipes etc were
                    sold at a price 5 to 10 times their original price and due
                    to huge spike in their demand. As every person relies on
                    life dependencies and in the covid era, every soul had to
                    rely on medical facilities as well, these industries made
                    huge wins.

                    Racism:<br />
                    In most of the indian cities and areas, migrant workers are
                    mostly of lower caste as suggested by the indian system. And
                    the people who are born in lower castes are always
                    associated with such physical and low level jobs.<br /><br />
                    Gendered:<br />
                    even though the situations have improved in recent times but
                    still a majority of the workers doing physical work consists
                    of male. The proportion of women has increased tremendously
                    in the office work segment but not in the lowest layer that
                    consists of physical workers.<br /><br />
                    Education:<br />The low skilled and less educated segment of
                    the society is usually associated with such jobs. Because
                    the importance of education and degrees is rising day by
                    day, we can say that not having proper education makes a
                    perception of a person in the minds of people that he has to
                    be associated with this kind of work.<br /><br />
